            <h3>Hi!</h3>
            <p>
              I'm a passionate Full Stack Developer with a strong foundation in
              both front-end and back-end technologies. I have a deep
              understanding of modern web development, and I enjoy building
              seamless, user-friendly applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a solid background in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and experience in
              frameworks like React for front-end development, I bring ideas to
              life with clean, efficient code. On the back-end, I have expertise
              in Node.js, Express, using/creating restful API and PostgreSQL,
              ensuring that the applications I build are robust, scalable, and
              secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you can find me online playing my favorite game
              Dota 2 ðŸ˜Š.
