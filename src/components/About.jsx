            I am a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong commitment to continuous learning and growth. I thrive on creating clean, fast, efficient, user-friendly, and fully responsive web applications that solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
            With a solid background in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and experience in frameworks like React and Bootstrap for front-end development, I bring ideas to life with clean, efficient code. On the back-end, I have expertise in Node.js, Express, and databases like PostgreSQL, ensuring that the applications I build are robust, scalable, and secure.
            </p>
            <p class="lead mb-4">
            I was also a customer service representative for 10 years before changing my career to a web developer. Currently, when I'm not coding, I help manage our small coffee shop in the city.
